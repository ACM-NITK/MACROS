# MACROS 1.0
#### An initiative to help members explore the various domains in computer science through a series of curated tasks.
---
#### For participants 
- Every 3/4 weeks a task will be designed and associated repo will be created. This page will serve as an index for the same and links to the repositories can be found here. 
- Most tasks will consist of a preliminary and additional bonus task of higher difficulty level. It is recommended to attempt both.
- The README.md file of the task repo will contain the task description, submission details and links to relevant resources.
- Fork the related repository and upon completing the task, create a folder labelled with your name and create a PR. 
- The task will be reviewed and upon satisfactory completion of the preliminary task, the PR will be merged.

#### For mentors
- Design a suitable task and create a repository (MACROS-1.0-Task_Name) with a README.md containing details of the task. Also provide a bonus task of higher difficulty.
- Provide useful links which will serve as starting point for complete beginners.
- Update or create a PR to update this index page.
- Mention the contact details of the mentor in charge.
- Periodically review the PRs submitted and merge upon satisfactory completion of the preliminary task.
